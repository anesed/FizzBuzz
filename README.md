# FizzBuzz

This repository contains sample code with the classic FizzBuzz program, chiefly to showcase some aspects of my coding style.

This particular variant uses no explicit `if` statements but it has a for loop and one could argue that the termination expression is effectively an `if` statement, so the program should still stick to the "use only one `if`" rule.
